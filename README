About:
------

Nicky Boum is a classic platformer game initially designed for the Amiga. The
game was published by Microids in 1992 and was also ported to the Atari ST and
PC EGA platforms.

This project aims to rewrite the original engine of the game and requires the
original datafiles.

This rewrite is based on the reversing of the Amiga and PC versions.

The engine initially designed for Nicky Boum was re-used, along with several
modifications in 2 games also distributed by Microids : Nicky 2 (1993) and
Carlos (1994). Currently, only Nicky Boum and Nicky 2 are playable with this
project.


Requirements:
-------------

You need the original DOS version data files. The list is :

	*.BLK (Nicky Boum)
	*.CDG (Nicky Boum)
	*.REF (Nicky Boum)
	*.SPR (Nicky Boum)
	*.SQX (Nicky 2)

You also need some extra datafiles which can be downloaded from the project
webpage.


Running the SDL version:
------------------------

Download the extra datafiles package and extract its contents to the directory
containing the original files.

By default, the engine will try to load the game data files from the current
directory. You can change that by using the command line options.

The game keys are :

	Arrow Keys   move Nicky
	Space/Ctrl   action button
	'i'          toggle inventory display
	'p'          pause the game
	F1           cheat mode, gives you all bonuses
	F2           cheat mode, jumps to the next level


Running the GBA version:
-------------------------

The game keys are :

	Keypad       move Nicky
	A/B          action button
	Select       toggle inventory display
	Start        pause the game
